What is Family Connect ?
Family Connect is an innovative Android application designed to bring families closer together by simplifying household management and fostering positive behavior.

 Our group project focuses on creating a family-oriented android application that combines a shared calendar, task management and positive behavior development. Users can assign tasks and progresses earn points upon completion and collectively work towards rewards. The app also encourages authentic task verification among family members. Age-specific behavior development for 7-12 and 13-19-year-olds under parents supervison is a key feature. Additionally, users can create activities into a blackboard-like interface then share and chat completed or planned events with relatives. This project enhances family organization and promotes positive interactions, offering a practical and engaging solution for households.

Our Motivation
In an era dominated by digital screens, familial bonds can fray, as smartphones and tablets often lead to fragmented communication and a lack of engagement within households. Our project's motivation lies in addressing these modern-day family challenges. We are driven by the desire to trigger family connections and simplify household task management while promoting positive behaviors among family members.
